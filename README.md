# Hyper Island 25 - Data analyst, Python assessment

In this folder, you will find a [ETL pipeline](pipeline_assestment.py) and a [Jupyter notebook](Petrol_iceland.ipynb).

## ETL pipeline
I decided to fetch data from an [API](https://docs.apis.is/#endpoint-petrol) that contains fuel prices in Iceland across all gas stations. In the pipeline, the data is fetched and transformed/cleaned up before eventually being saved to `"petrol_data.csv"`.

## Jupyter notebook
The notebook reads the CSV file and does some analysis of the data. I came up with a few questions I wanted answers to and made some visualizations alongside them.
